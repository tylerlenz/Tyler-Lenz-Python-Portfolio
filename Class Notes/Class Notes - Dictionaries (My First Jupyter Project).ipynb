    "\n",
    "A dictionary is a fundemental data structure that stores data objects that are linked to keys. Data objects can be strings (\"text\"), numbers (floats or integers), dataframes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be easy to navigate and store large sets of data with their keys and key values.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are keys?: Keys are inputs linked to a specific output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries help show the relationship in this fashion {key:object}. These may seem very basic, as it is no different than a true dictionary, where the words would be the 'keys' and the definitions would be the 'objects'. Like in regards to a language, dictionaries are a building block for coding.\n",

    "For example, we can create a basic dictionary that shows a few Chevrolet models.\n",
