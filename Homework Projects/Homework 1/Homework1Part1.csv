Future Plans,"I am still undetermined. With the current pandemic situation, a lot of my summer plans got canceled with internships and such. But, I would love to work somewhere where I can play with big data and do company projections for something that interests me. But my ultimate dream is to work for a sports franchise and work on player values."
Motivation,"I am very interested in linear programming/networking, so this class seems very applicable. It also seemed like the most interesting elective."
